========================= PROMPT =========================


Write a function to find the top k integers that occur most frequently from given lists of sorted and distinct integers using heap queue algorithm. Your code should pass these tests:

assert func([[1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8], [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]],3)==[5, 7, 1]
assert func([[1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8], [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]],1)==[1]
assert func([[1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8], [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]],5)==[6, 5, 7, 8, 1]```python



========================= FINAL GENERATION =========================

from heapq import heappush, heappop, heappush

def func(nums: list[list[int]], k: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    d = {}
    for sublist in nums:
        for num in sublist:
        if num in d:
            d[num] += 1
        else:
            d[num] = 1
    result = []
    heap = []
    for key, value in d.items():
        heappush(heap, value)
        if len(heap) > k:
            heappop(heap)
        result.append(heappop(heap))
    return result
